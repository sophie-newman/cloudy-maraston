JADES - NIRSpec - Year 2
Emission line flux table
------------------------

RELEASE: v3.0
DATE: 27 March 2024


Description:
Table of redshifts and emission line fluxes from JADES NIRSpec observations.
Further details can be found in the JADES NIRSpec Data Release 3 Paper
(D'Eugenio et al. 2023).

Two tables are included in this release.

##1: hlsp_jades_jwst_nirspec_goods-s-deephst_clear-prism_line-fluxes_v1.0_catalog.fits
3#2: hlsp_jades_jwst_nirspec_goods-s-deephst_gratings_line-fluxes_v1.0_catalog.fits

Table 1 reports fluxes of emission lines measured from low-resolution
CLEAR/PRISM observations.
Table 2 reports emission line fluxes measured from medium-resolution (R~1000)
F070LP/G140M, F170LP/G235Mand F290LP/G395M observations.

Both tables also report redshifts (measured from the combined low- and
medium-resolution data), and information about the targeting and observations.
A more detailed description of the columns is given below.
More details can be found in D'Eugenio et al. (2023).

-----------------------
Note on target IDs
NIRSpec_ID values contain duplicates due to the fact that the input photometric
catalog was updated frequently throughout the survey. Different targets may 
share the same NIRSpec_ID, even including in the same observing program (PID).
To match galaxies to their spectra, the recommended procedure is to use both the
NIRSpec_ID and TIER  columns.
Repeat observations of the same target may or may not have the same NIRSpec_ID.
NIRCam_ID values are unique, but not all targets have a NIRCam_ID.

Description of columns:
-----------------------

NIRSpec_ID     : ID used in the NIRSpec input target selection catalog (see note
                  on target IDs)
TIER           : Used to uniquely identify observations (see note on target IDs)
PID            : Program ID of the observations
Field          : A string denoting the target field.
NIRCam_ID      : ID of the closest match within 0.2" in the JADES NIRCam data
                  release catalogue (Robertson et al. 2024). Values of -9999
                  mean that no source exists within 0.2" (due to re-segmentation
                  of the images). Values of -1111 indicate targets outside the
                  NIRCam footprint.
RA_TARG        : Right Ascension of target as used for target allocation and
                  pathloss correction

                  pathloss correction
RA_NIRCam      : Right Ascension of the closest match within 0.2" in the JADES
                  NIRCam data release catalogue (Robertson et al. 2024)
Dec_NIRCam     : Declination of the closest match within 0.2" in the JADES
                  NIRCam data release catalogue (Robertson et al. 2024)

General words on using reported Prism emission line fluxes:
 - Which lines are blended changes as a function of redshift. For example,
   above z>5.3, H-beta, [OIII]4959, [OIII]5007 are well separated and reported
   independently. Between 2<z<5.3 H-beta is reported separately, but
   [OIII]4959+5007 is reported as a blend ("O3_5007d"). Below z<2, the entire
   complex is reported as a blend ("Blnd_HB_O3_5007d")
 - There will be cases where reported lines fluxes contain contributions from
   blending with other faint lines, not explicitly listed here.
   For example, [NeIII]3869 can be blended with HeI 3889 emission.
   The reported flux in such cases reflects the whole complex.

Description of columns:
-----------------------

*Columns are as for the Table 1 above except for:

z_PRISM        : Redshift derived from S/N>5 emission lines in the
                  R~1000 grating spectra of this object (if applicable).
[LineID]_flux  : Measured emission line flux from the R~1000 spectra in units
                  of x10^-20 erg s-1 cm-2. (See list of emission lines below)
[LineID]_err    : Uncertainty on measured emission lines flux

Note: There is typically spectral overlap between the G140M/F070LP and
G235M/F170LP spectra and the G235M/F170LP and G395M/F290LP spectra. In cases
where are prominent emission line falls in an overlapping region (and thus
detected in two independent observations), we une the lowest-resolution observation
(reddest grating) which has generally higher S/N.
